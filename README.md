# MixPanel-R
R based mixpanel API connector

The MixPanel-R project allows you to export data from MixPanel to your R code for futher analysis.
Only 1 method of Mixpanel API is added, but the rest of them can be added easily.
The script was initially taken and highly refactored from here: https://github.com/megfitz/mixpanel-API-to-R
